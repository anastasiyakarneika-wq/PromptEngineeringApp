If you exceed it, pages are silently dropped\noff the end.\n\nThere should be no such limit.  No matter how far I have browsed I should be\nable to get all the way back to the beginning.\n\n[Note this is not the same as bug 62010.  That bug is about the length of the\ndrop-down menu.  This is about the total length of the session history.]",
