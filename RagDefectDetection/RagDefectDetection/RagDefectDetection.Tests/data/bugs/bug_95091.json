For example a handler of \"foo %s\" should not have the temp\nfilename appended, but should have the %s replaced by it.  A handler of\njust \"foo\" should have the temp filename appended to it:\n\nif (substring(helper_app, \"%s\")) {\n    replace(helper_app, \"%s\", tempfile);\n} else {\n    strcat(helper_app, tempfile);\n}",
