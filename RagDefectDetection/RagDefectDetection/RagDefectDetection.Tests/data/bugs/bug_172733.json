Type in some text in the Find textarea until the bookmark from step 1 is no\nlonger shown and there is some whitespace in the sidebar.\n3. Right click on the whitespace\n\nResult:\nThe context menu corresponds to the bookmark selected in step 1.\n\nThis is probably just a symptom of Bug 156576, but I'm suggesting we hide 156576 \nby deselecting the selected bookmark in the sidebar as soon as a bookmark search\nstarts.",
