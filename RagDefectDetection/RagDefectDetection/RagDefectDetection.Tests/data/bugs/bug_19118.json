Under each mime type there should be a list of\ninstalled plug-ins that can handle that mime type.  Radio buttons can be used to\nselect the plug-in the user prefers for that mime type.\n\nFor example\n\n audio/midi\n    O LiveAudio\n    O LiveUpdate Crescendo version 4.02\n    O QuickTime Plug-in 4.0.3\n audio/aiff\n    O LiveAudio\n    O QuickTime Plug-in 4.0.3",
