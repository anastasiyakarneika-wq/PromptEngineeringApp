I can login to ftp server, browse but can't\ndownload files with some extensions (ie 'file.jpg' = failure, but *the same*\n'file' = succes and also 'file.exe' = succes). I have tried this on solaris ftp\nserver and proftp on debian.\n\nReproducible: Always\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.Login to ftp server\n2.Click on file with extension (for example file.jpg)\n3.(Picture displays in mozilla window) Choosing (RMB) Save image as...\n4.Mozilla asks a password (why?)! I have been already logged in.\n5.Entering password\n6.Dialog window opens to save my file somewhere... Choosing ok\n7.Opens download status window... and quickly closes\n8.No file on my local hdd\n \n\nWell,  Generally shift + LMB does not work at all either. Anyway I can download\nbut only under one condition: there must appear one window: after clicking on a\nfile there must appear window which asks: open using something... or save this\nfile to disk. Than the file is really copied to my local hdd.\n\nMaybe something with mime is wrong?"
