(I just checked\nnightly build 2002032113 and the keyboard accelerator works just fine, even\nthough the menu commands aren't present.)\n\nThis is important to me, because I leave the bookmarks window open all of the\ntime, with browser windows closed, and I keep tripping over this missing\nkeyboard command.",
