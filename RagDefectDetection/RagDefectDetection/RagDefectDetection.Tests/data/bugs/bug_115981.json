There, the user has quick access to all directories\nhe has deemed as important enough to want quick access to.\n\nFor instance, I am currently managing about 10 projects at my company and have a\n\"favorite\" defined for each project. I also have an additional 10-20 favorites\nfor other network directories (e.g., proposals, report templates, technical\ndata, etc). Now, whenever I receice attachments from clients, it would be very\nuseful to be able to quickly select that project's directory and save the files\nthere.\n\nSuggested UI:\n\n+- Open/Save a file -----------------------------------------+\n|                      ________________________________      |\n| Recent directories: |________________________________|\\/|  | <-- bug 115574 :)\n| ---------------------------------------------------------- |\n|           _______________________                          |\n| Look in: |_______________________|\\/| |^|  [FavIco]        | <-- fav-icon here\n| +--------------------------------------------------------+ |\n| | files (favs) listed here                               | |\n| |                                                        | |\n| |                                                        | |\n\nIf bug 115574 is possible (modify open/save dialogues) and \"a good idea\" then\nthis one must at least be one too :)\n\nWould this apply to other OS's (Linux, Mac) too?",
