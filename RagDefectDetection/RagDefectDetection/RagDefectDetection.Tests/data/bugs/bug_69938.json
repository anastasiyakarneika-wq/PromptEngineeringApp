This is incorrect behaviour, and leads to broken\ndownloads, full /tmp dir, and possibly worse. Many systems (mine\nincluded) have a restricted size for /tmp, so trying to download\nany file larger than that size will fail - even though you have\nselected to save it into a path that DOES have enough space.\n\nReproducible: Always\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.Restrict /tmp size (seperate partition etc)\n2.Download a file larger than /tmp capacity\n3.Watch /tmp fill up and download fail\n\nActual Results:  A file of random size (less than orginal size) is created in the\nselected destination. Temp file appears to remain in /tmp dir.\n\nExpected Results:  Mozilla should save the file DIRECTLY into the selected path,\nrather then save it into /tmp then move it",
