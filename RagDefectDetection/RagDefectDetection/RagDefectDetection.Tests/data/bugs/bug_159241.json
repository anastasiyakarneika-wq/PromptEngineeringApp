This is something else we could be saving and should be easy\nenough to do.\n\nFrom Bug 148797 Comment #25 (by me):\n\nAdam, just came to my mind when seeing this checkin in bonsai: what about <link\nrel=\"icon\" ...> (or \"shortcut icon\")?\nShouldn't that be saved with the page as well?\n\nEnough said. Would be a nice thing to do, IMHO.",
