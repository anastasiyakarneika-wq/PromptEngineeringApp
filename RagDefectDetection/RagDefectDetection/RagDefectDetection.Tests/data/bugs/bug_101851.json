And you can choose these entries to do bizarre things\nto the dialog.\n\nFrom looking at this with Spy++, it looks like it's due to the DS_MODALFRAME bit\n(0x00000080) being set on the dialog's window styles.  I did a quick sample app\nand could reproduce this result;  getting rid of DS_MODALFRAME in my sample app\nmade the system menu behave correctly.  I'm not sure how or what sets the style\nbits for the dialog, but I'm guessing this belongs in XP Toolkit/Widgets.",
