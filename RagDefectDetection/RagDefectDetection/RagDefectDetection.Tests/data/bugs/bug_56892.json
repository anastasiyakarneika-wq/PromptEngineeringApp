Hence when I slide my\nfinger down the edge the window does not scroll.Scrolling does not work with the\ntouch pad in all of the components. In Netscape 4.7 the scrolling works just\nfine.And works on most other programs in windows.\n\n\nReproducible: Always\nSteps to Reproduce:\nLaunch the browser on any machine with a synaptics touchpad.
