    "summary_and_description": "Optimize startup performance through deferred toolbar loading\n\nProposed Solution:\nCurrently, the browser appears to fully render all toolbar elements (including processing bookmarks.htm) before displaying the main window. This likely introduces measurable delay during startup. \n\nTechnical Observation:\n- Toolbar button rendering may consume >100ms\n- Bookmarks.htm processing (especially large files) compounds this delay\n\nSuggested Improvement:\n1. Display the main window immediately with empty toolbar containers\n2. Load and render toolbar components asynchronously after UI paint\n\nRationale:\nAs demonstrated in other applications (like text editors), this creates perceived faster startup while maintaining functionality. The psychological impact of early window display outweighs minor subsequent loading delays.\n\nImplementation Note:\nThis would require separating toolbar initialization into:\n- Phase 1: Structural rendering (instant)\n- Phase 2: Content population (async)\n\nDeveloper Context:\n(Original submitter confirms experience implementing similar optimizations in toolbar-heavy applications)"
