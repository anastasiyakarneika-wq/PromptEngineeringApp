    "summary_and_description": "FTP download failures for specific file extensions\n\nEnvironment:\n- Mozilla 1.0+ (Linux, Build 2002072204)\n- Tested with Solaris and Debian (proftpd) servers\n\nCore Issue:\nSuccessful FTP authentication but download failures occur for certain file extensions (.jpg) while others work (.exe, extensionless files).\n\nReproduction Steps:\n1. Authenticate via ftp://username@host\n2. Attempt to download file with problematic extension (e.g., file.jpg)\n3. Observe unexpected behaviors:\n   a) Images display inline instead of downloading\n   b) Repeated password prompts despite active session\n   c) Download dialog appears but file not saved\n\nWorkaround:\nFiles only download successfully when the 'Open With/Save As' dialog appears (triggered inconsistently).\n\nTechnical Analysis:\nSuspected MIME type handling issue where:\n- Some extensions trigger inline handling\n- Others bypass proper FTP transfer logic\n- Session state may not persist through password reprompts"
