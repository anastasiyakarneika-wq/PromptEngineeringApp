Activate bookmarks panel and highlight any bookmark/folder\n2. Perform a search that filters out the initially selected bookmark, leaving empty space\n3. Right-click the blank area\n\nObserved Behavior:\nThe right-click menu shows options for the previously selected (now hidden) bookmark instead of being empty.\n\nRoot Cause:\nLikely related to selection state persistence during searches (see Bug 156576). Suggested fix: Clear selection when initiating a search."
