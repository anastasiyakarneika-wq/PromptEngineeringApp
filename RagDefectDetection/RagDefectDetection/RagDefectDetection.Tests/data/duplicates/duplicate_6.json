    "summary_and_description": "URL encoding issue when saving web pages with spaces\n\nProblem:\nWhen saving complete web pages containing spaces in their paths:\n1. Spaces are initially encoded as %20 (correct)\n2. Upon loading the saved page, %20 becomes double-encoded as %2520 (incorrect)\n\nReproduction:\n1. Save a page with spaces (e.g., 'http://example.com/space test.html')\n2. Local save path converts spaces to %20\n3. When reopening, embedded resources fail due to %2520 in paths\n\nExample:\nOriginal URL: http://www.mozilla.org/space test.html\nSaved as: file:///c:/My%20Documents/space%20test.html\nResource paths incorrectly resolve to: space%2520test_files/image.jpg\n\nTechnical Analysis:\n- First encoding pass: space → %20 (expected)\n- Second encoding pass: % → %25 (unexpected double-encoding)\n- Affects all local file:/// paths containing originally-spaced URLs\n\nImpact:\nBreaks offline viewing of saved pages containing spaces in their original paths"
