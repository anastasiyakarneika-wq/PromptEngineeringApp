  "summary_and_description": "FTP downloads fail for files with special characters in filenames, while plain names work\n\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.1b) Gecko/20020722\nBuildID: 2002072204\n\nI've encountered an issue where Mozilla fails to download files containing special characters (e.g., spaces, accents, or symbols) via FTP, while files with simple alphanumeric names download successfully. For example, 'my file (v2).txt' fails, but 'myfile.txt' works. This occurs across multiple FTP servers including Solaris and ProFTP on Debian.\n\nReproducible: Always\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Login to FTP server\n2. Attempt to download a file with special characters (e.g., 'report 2024.pdf' or 'résumé.doc')\n3. File transfer fails with an encoding error\n4. No download status window appears\n5. No file is saved locally\n\nExpected Behavior:\nFiles with special characters should download as reliably as plain filenames.\n\nThis is unrelated to extension-based issues, as it occurs even when extensions are correct. The problem appears to stem from improper URL encoding of special characters in FTP requests."
