  "summary_and_description": "Page transition animation stutters when back/forward navigation cache is purged\n\nWhen using back/forward navigation between heavy pages, the smooth sliding animation frequently stutters or breaks completely when the page cache has been partially cleared. This creates a jarring user experience during what should be fluid navigation.\n\nObserved particularly when:\n1. Returning to media-heavy pages like www.mozilla.org/demos\n2. After prolonged browsing sessions\n3. When system memory is constrained\n\nThe expected behavior would maintain smooth animation regardless of cache state by:\n1. Preserving minimal rendering resources for transitions\n2. Gracefully degrading animation quality rather than stuttering\n3. Providing visual consistency in navigation feedback\n\nThis differs from favicon flickering because:\n1. Affects the core page transition animation, not peripheral UI elements\n2. Related to rendering pipeline performance rather than asset loading\n3. Occurs specifically during history navigation\n4. Requires solutions focused on animation subsystem resilience"
