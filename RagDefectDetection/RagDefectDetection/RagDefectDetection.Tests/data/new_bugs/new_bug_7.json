  "summary_and_description": "Open file dialog has system menu with minimize and move enabled when they shouldn't be\n\nThe open file dialog correctly disables the minimize button in the title bar, but right-clicking the title bar reveals that the minimize and move options in the system menu remain enabled. Selecting these options causes unusual behavior with the dialog.\n\nTechnical analysis shows this occurs due to the WS_MINIMIZEBOX style bit being incorrectly set while the minimize button is visually disabled. A test application confirmed removing this style bit corrects the system menu behavior.\n\nThis differs from the save dialog issue because:\n1. It affects the open file dialog instead of save/download dialogs\n2. The problematic options are minimize and move rather than maximize and size\n3. Involves different window style bits (WS_MINIMIZEBOX instead of DS_MODALFRAME)\n4. Results in different types of dialog corruption when misused"
