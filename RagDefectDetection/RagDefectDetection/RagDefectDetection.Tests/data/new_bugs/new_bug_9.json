  "summary_and_description": "Saved pages lose dynamic updates when containing live data feeds\n\nWhen saving pages with auto-updating content (e.g., stock tickers, live sports scores), the saved file captures only the initial static snapshot rather than preserving the data update mechanism.\n\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:0.9.3+) Gecko/20010817\nBuildID: 2001082012\n\nReproducible: Always\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. Load a page with live-updating content\n2. Wait for multiple data updates\n3. Save the page during active updates\n4. Open saved file\n\nActual Results:\nSaved file contains only the initial data state without update logic\n\nExpected Results:\nSaved file should either:\n1) Preserve the update mechanism, or\n2) Explicitly save the final rendered state\n\nThis differs from form/MIME saving issues because:\n1. Involves persistent data streams rather than form submissions\n2. Requires handling of active JavaScript states\n3. Needs timestamped data preservation\n4. Affects different use cases (financial/sports sites vs form results)"
