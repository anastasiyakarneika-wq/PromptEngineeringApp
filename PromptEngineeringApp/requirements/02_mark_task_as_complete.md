## Requirement 2: Mark Task as Completed
Application: TodoMVC is a simple web application for managing a to-do list. Users can add, complete, delete, and filter tasks. The following requirements define the functionality to be tested using automated Playwright scripts.
User Story: As a user, I want to mark a task as completed so that I can track my progress.
Acceptance Criteria:
The user can check the checkbox next to a task.
Completed tasks are visually distinguished (e.g., strikethrough or faded text).
The "items left" counter decreases when a task is marked completed.
