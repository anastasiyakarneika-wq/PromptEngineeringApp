## Requirement 3: Delete Task

Application: TodoMVC is a simple web application for managing a to-do list. Users can add, complete, delete, and filter tasks. The following requirements define the functionality to be tested using automated Playwright scripts.

User Story: As a user, I want to delete a task so that I can remove tasks I no longer need.

Acceptance Criteria:

Hovering over a task displays a delete button (e.g., an "x" icon).

Clicking the delete button removes the task from the list.

The "items left" counter updates accordingly.
