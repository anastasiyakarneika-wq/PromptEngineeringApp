Application: TodoMVC is a simple web application for managing a to-do list. Users can add, complete, delete, and filter tasks. The following requirements define the functionality to be tested using automated Playwright scripts.

User Story: As a user, I want to filter tasks (All, Active, Completed) so that I can focus on specific tasks.

Acceptance Criteria:

The footer contains links for "All", "Active", and "Completed".

Clicking "Active" shows only incomplete tasks.

Clicking "Completed" shows only completed tasks.

Clicking "All" shows all tasks.

The selected filter is highlighted.
