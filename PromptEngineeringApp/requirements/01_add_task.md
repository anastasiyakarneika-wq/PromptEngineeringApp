## Requirement 1: Add Task

Application: TodoMVC is a simple web application for managing a to-do list. Users can add, complete, delete, and filter tasks. The following requirements define the functionality to be tested using automated Playwright scripts.

User Story: As a user, I want to add a new task to my to-do list so that I can track my tasks.

Acceptance Criteria:

The user can enter a task name in the input field with placeholder "What needs to be done?".

Pressing Enter adds the task to the list.

The task appears in the list with a checkbox (unchecked) and the task name.

The input field is cleared after adding a task.

Empty or whitespace-only tasks are not added.
